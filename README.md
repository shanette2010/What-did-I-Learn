# What-Did-I-Learn


The more I dive into this class. The more Im learning to love it!
From watching the video's and going over material provided by our teacher.
There were some thing I was able to understand and other sujects I know ill need to do further research on.
The things I was able understand was the = sign is an assignment operator. 
So whent writting it in vscode. You will type the word const, which is used to variable that cannot be reassigned. (reserve a spot).
After writting const you will have the made up name of the file, then assignment operator, then lastly what your wanting or your command.
And make sure you put a semi colon after each statement. 
Just like the word const you can also use the word let to declare a variable that can be reassigned (dating). 
You can use Booleans are used to represent true or false values. And use "" to declare a string.
Strings, numbers, and Booleans are all const. But also known as a premative data type or one single piece of data.
What did peak my interest and made me want to learn more was using booleans to represent ture or false values in VScode. 
I didnt quite understand how to use it. Also i didnt understand how can numeric vaules be effectively represented and manipulated using 
numbers in VScode? So through out the rest of this course I hope we can touch on those two subjects a bit more so I can have 
a better understand on how to use them properly.
